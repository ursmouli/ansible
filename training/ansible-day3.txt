grouping key names:
-------------------
- ungrouped
- grouped (works till version 2.5 only)
- all | *

adhoc commands:
---------------
> ansible lab,class --list-host
> ansible 'lab,&class' --list-host (display common hosts in both i.e. union)
> ansible-playbook --tags=untagged play.yml (executes untagged only)
> ansible-playbook --tags=tagged play.yml (executes tagged only)


dynamic inventory:
--------------------
- program must return inventory in json format (can be written in any programming lang)

import_playbook:
-----------------
- including more imports and inlcudes might slightly slowdown performance
- once import_playbook added then we cannot include host, tasks and handlers cause all those are included in imported playbook

include_task or import_task:
-----------------------------
- loops cannot be used in place where we use import_task

roles:
------

notes:
------
- when we apply condtion on block it will applied to individual task inside block
- tags in task is important to run specific task in playbook
